# RadiaLumia-Sensors
Arduino code for listening to Radia's sensor inputs and sending messages to the central computer

## Todo
- [x] Update code to send LX data every loop, not only when changed
- [ ] Electrical tape around load cell connectors to reinforce thin wires
- [ ] Replace USB programming cable on anemometer box with data cable
- [ ] Calibrate anemometer to actual wind speed
- [ ] Test how the sensors work with the springs in the manual shells
