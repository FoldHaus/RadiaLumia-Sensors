## Todo
- [x] Update code to send LX data every loop, not only when changed
- [x] Electrical tape around load cell connectors to reinforce thin wires
- [x] Replace USB programming cable on anemometer box with data cable
- [x] Test how the sensors work with the springs in the manual shells
- [ ] Calibrate anemometer to actual wind speed (on the playa)
- [ ] Calibrate manual pull shells to load cell range (on the playa)
